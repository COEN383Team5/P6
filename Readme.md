# COEN282 P6

This repo has code to create 5 processes, which write to a pipe, while the original process reads from the pipes and writes what it recieves to a file. This process continues for 30 seconds. It was made to satisfy an assignment for COEN383: Advanced Operating Systems at Santa Clara University.

To compile:
'''
make

To execute:

Sample output is provided in output.txt, which was generated while I was slamming my keyboard. A report of what I found difficult about program this can be found in report.txt.
