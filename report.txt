I could not get select to reliably pick up on when a pipe had data when I used
only a single fd_set, so I had to use an array of fd_set that is the length of
the number of children. 

I noticed that sometimes the pipe would have one extra byte to the output that
was not valid ascii, so I wrote a function to ensure that the last bytes
written to the file are a newline. 

Also, if the struct timevalue used for the timeout of select(2) had too small
of a value, select would say there is data to be read, and read would read the
same data multiple times.

I also came to the conclusion that select(2) and the subsequent FD functions
required to use select(2) have poor documentation, and are not as reliable as
setting the fd to only support nonblocking calls using ioctl(2) and checking
to see if errno==EAGAIN when read(2) returns. Plus the fd_set doesn't do very
well with more than one fd in the set, which makes it pointless.
